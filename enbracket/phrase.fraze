𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 In Lithuanian, "phrase" is translated to "frazė".

⨍ resolve «x» in «e» ⎨
   if «x» is a var then ⎨
       𝓈𝒶𝓋ℯ «x»
       get 𝑖𝑡s value in «e»
       if 𝑖𝑡 is a var then ⎨
           ✓ 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 «x» is already saved as 𝑖𝑡
       ⎬ else ⎨
           resolve 𝑖𝑡 again 𝑖𝑛 «e» 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑡 might, again, be compound
       ⎬
  ⎬
  if «x» is not compound then ⎨
       𝓈𝒶𝓋ℯ «x»
       ✓ 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 we're done
  ⎬
  if «x» is compound and is not a var then ⎨
      𝓈𝒶𝓋ℯ «x»
      break 𝑖𝑡 down into parts and return a compound with each element deeply resolved 𝑖𝑛 «e»
